Here is a list of the workshops that I have created, continue to maintain, and updating based on the new features that appear in the latest versions of the software.

* [Red Hat Quay Workshop](/quay-workshop) *(v3.7, v3.8)*
* [Red Hat Single Sign-On Workshop](/rhsso-workshop) *(v7.6)*
* [Red Hat Cloud-native Development Workshop](/cloud-native-development-workshop) *(v4.11-3.4-1.9-1.7)*

The Red Hat Single Sign-On Workshop focuses on securing applications and services, as well as configurations for integration and federation. Additionally, it offers **development** opportunities for programmers who want to extend and customize the product using the Service Provider Intefaces (SPI).

The SSO workshop was built from the ground up, making it the first one available for delivery in EMEA at the time of this writing.
