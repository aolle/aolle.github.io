Here is a list of the workshops that I have created, continue to maintain, and updating based on the new features that appear in the latest versions of the software.

* [Red Hat Quay Workshop](/quay-workshop) *current version v3.78*
* [Red Hat Single Sign-On Workshop](/rhsso-workshop) *current version v7.6*

The Red Hat Single Sign-On Workshop focuses on securing applications and services, as well as configurations for integration and federation. Additionally, it offers **development** opportunities for programmers who want to extend and customize the product using the Service Provider Intefaces (SPI).
